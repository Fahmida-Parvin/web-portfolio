       <p> <span class="fi">A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design – which has been created by either a client or a design team – and turns it into a website. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand.</p></span>
       <p><span class="ki">If you'd rather stick to just the one thing, web development is great for those wanting to become an expert.So, as I'm a hard-working person, I choose to become a web developer.</p></span>
